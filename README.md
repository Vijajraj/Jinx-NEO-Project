 Jinx NEO Project 

Welcome to Jinx — a Near Earth Object (NEO) hazard prediction and monitoring system powered by NASA APIs and AI.



Project Overview

Jinx is an AI-driven application that:
-  Fetches real-time and bulk Near Earth Object data from NASA’s Open APIs.
-  Trains machine learning models to predict potential hazards.
- Provides interactive visualizations (using Streamlit + Folium maps).
-  Can optionally send alerts via email or SMS (Twilio integration planned).
-  Compares different AI models for accuracy and reliability.
